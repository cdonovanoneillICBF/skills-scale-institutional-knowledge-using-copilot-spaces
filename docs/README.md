# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management knowledge base. This README serves as your entry point to understand how we run projects, coordinate delivery, and continuously improve our processes.

## Overview

OctoAcme employs **customer-first, iterative, and transparent** project management practices. Our approach emphasizes delivering value in small increments, maintaining clear ownership, and making data-informed decisions throughout the project lifecycle.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in every decision
- **Iterative delivery**: Ship small, testable increments frequently
- **Clear ownership**: Every project has named Project Managers and Product Leads
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and continuous improvement

### Project Lifecycle

Our projects follow a structured lifecycle with defined phases:

1. **Initiation** — Validate the business need, align stakeholders, and create a project one-pager
2. **Planning** — Break work into actionable increments, estimate effort, and identify dependencies
3. **Execution** — Build, test, review, and iterate with regular standups and demos
4. **Release** — Deploy to production with proper verification and rollback plans
5. **Continuous Improvement** — Run retrospectives and convert learnings into action items

### Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, approvals, and context
